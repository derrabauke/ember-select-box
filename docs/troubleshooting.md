# Troubleshooting

## Problem

Rendering lots of options is slow.

## Solution

If your select box only uses _primitive_ values, you do not need to use `<sb.Option>`, instead you can use a plain old `<option>` element ([Example](../tests/dummy/app/templates/fast-native-single-select.hbs#L25)). Which will be faster, because constructing components is expensive in Ember.
